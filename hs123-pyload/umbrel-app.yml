releaseNotes: >-
End of Life: Python 2 Support Dropped & Branch Deprecated
 Python 2.x has been deprecated for over 6 years, yet pyLoad continued to support it with v0.4.x until now. It's time to move on.

 This branch has now reached end-of-life.
 There will be no further updates, bug fixes, security patches, or new features here.

 Why This Change?
 Python 2 reached official end-of-life on January 1, 2020.
 Continuing support held back modern improvements and compatibility with current Python ecosystems.
